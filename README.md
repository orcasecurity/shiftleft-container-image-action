## Usage

### Workflow

```yaml
name: Sample Orca Container Image Scan Workflow
on:
  # Scan for each push event on your protected branch. If you have a different branch configured, please adjust the configuration accordingly by replacing 'main'.
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # NOTE: To enable scanning for pull requests, uncomment the section below.
  #pull_request:
    #branches: [ "main" ]
  # NOTE: To schedule a daily scan at midnight, uncomment the section below.
  #schedule:
    #- cron: '0 0 * * *'

### Output
By default, the scan output is displayed on the console, but you can choose to save the output to a specific directory as a file. You can specify the output directory using the `output` option as desribed in the [Inputs](https://github.com/orcasecurity/shiftleft-container-image-action/blob/main/README.md#inputs) section.

The output file name is following the format of `image<.output_format_extension>`.

For instance:
| Output format | Output directory | Output file path     |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| table         | results/         | results/image        |
| json          | results/         | results/image.json   |
| sarif         | results/         | results/image.sarif  |

## Upload SARIF report
If you have [GitHub code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/about-code-scanning) available you can use Orca Shift Left Security as a scanning tool
> **NOTE:**  Code scanning is available for all public repositories. Code scanning is also available in private repositories owned by organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and have a license for GitHub Advanced Security.

Configuration:

```yaml
name: Image Build, Scan and Upload Sarif

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
    build-cli:
      name: build-cli
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      permissions:
        security-events: write
      env: 
        IMAGE_NAME: <image name>
        PROJECT_KEY: <project key> # Set the desired project to run the cli scanning with
      
      steps:
      # checks-out your repository under $GitHub_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      # Build your docker image, that is going to be scanned in the next step
      - name: Docker Image Build
        run: docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .
  

      - name: Run Orca Container Image Scan
        uses: orcasecurity/shiftleft-container-image-action@v1
        id: orcasecurity_container_image_scan
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.ORCA_SECURITY_API_TOKEN }}
          project_key: ${{ env.PROJECT_KEY }}
          image: <image to scan>
          format: "sarif"
          output:
            "results/"
      - name: Upload SARIF file
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        if: ${{ always() && steps.orcasecurity_container_image_scan.outputs.exit_code != 1 }}
        with:
          sarif_file: results/image.sarif
```

The results list can be found on the security tab of your GitHub project and should look like the following image

![](/assets/container_scanning_list.png)

An entry should describe the error and in which line it occurred 

![](/assets/scanned_entry.png)
